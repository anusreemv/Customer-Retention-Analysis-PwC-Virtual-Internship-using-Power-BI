## ‚ùó Problem Statement
PhoneNow Telecoms faced challenges with retaining customers. The Retention Manager found that their existing Excel-based analysis was insufficient for proactive retention strategies. They needed a more comprehensive, data-driven approach to identify at-risk customers before they churn. The goal was to create a Power BI dashboard that:

- Provides an overview of customer retention.
- Identifies customers at risk of churn.
- Offers actionable insights to drive retention strategies.

## Key KPIs
The following KPIs were defined to assess customer retention and churn:

- **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who terminate their contracts.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Average value of a customer over their entire relationship with the company.
- **Tenure**: Length of time customers have been with PhoneNow Telecoms.
- **Contract Type**: The type of contract (monthly, annual) and its correlation with churn.
- **Payment Method**: Impact of payment method on customer retention.
- **Service Subscriptions**: The effect of service subscriptions (e.g., phone service, streaming services) on customer churn.

## üîç Insights
The analysis revealed the following insights:

- A significant portion of churned customers fall within the 0‚Äì12 months tenure range, with the highest churn occurring in the initial months.  
- Customers using **Fiber Optic** services show a higher tendency to churn compared to other service types.  
- These patterns indicate that early customer experience and service quality, especially for fiber optic users, are key factors driving churn.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights, the following recommendations were made to improve customer retention:

- Implement an early engagement program to gather and act on feedback from new customers, especially within the first few months.  
- Enhance the reliability and performance of fiber optic services to reduce dissatisfaction and prevent churn.  
- Consider offering loyalty incentives or personalized support to customers during their initial tenure period.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Power Query was essential for data validation, cleaning, and transformation to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
- **Calculated Measures**: DAX was used extensively for creating calculated measures like churn rate, customer lifetime value, and subscription analysis, which were crucial for generating insights.
- **Visualization Best Practices**: Effective use of Power BI visuals (bar charts, pie charts etc) helped in presenting complex data in a user-friendly manner.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzing customer segments (based on tenure, contract type, and service subscriptions) helped in identifying high-risk groups for targeted retention efforts.
